# Xchange powered by Xsauce Labs

Xsauce is a dynamic, decentralized ecosystem which allows you to translate your knowledge of culture into money in your pocket.
The founding belief of Xsauce is that cultural assets are a legitimate asset class. 

For clarity, when we say cultural assets, we are referring to assets that derive their value from cultural significance rather than a pure measure of utility.

Our immediate focus is on hyped or rare sneakers as they offer sustained value as evidenced through the rapidly growing $10 billion+ sneaker resale market.
